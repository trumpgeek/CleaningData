I know you are expecting to read all of the information in the README.md file e but can I please direct you to the CookBook.md file as this contains a lot more detail on this project

The run_analysis.R
-------------------
The steps are simple, we do some prep to so as to get a clean Train data and then we do the same process for Test.
Then we combine each clean Train and Test data sets into one, we then out put this.
Then we calculate the averages and out put this.

You can run this code and see how it behaves. Make sure that the program is also sitting in the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory and it will get the input files and output the results in the same place.

I urge you please to read the CookBook.md - it has more details.
